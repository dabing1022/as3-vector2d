Vectors for Actionscript 3
===============
I got some vector knowledge from the "[Vectors for Flash][tutorial]" (written by TONYPA) tutorial.  But, the samples of the tutorial are written in Flash 5 and Actionscript 1, and the Actionscript 3 is now mainstream.

I shall migrate the samples from Flash 5 + Actionscrip 1 to Actionscript 3.

I used the [FlashDevelop][fd] to build them.
